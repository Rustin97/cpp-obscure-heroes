# Superhero Database

This C++ project implements a small superhero database that demonstrates:
- Use of multidimensional arrays (to store year and comic universe)
- Use of parallel arrays (to store names, superpowers, and weaknesses)
- Case-insensitive search using string manipulation functions (tolower, toupper, find)
- Sorting algorithms (alphabetical sort and bonus: sort by ranking)
- Dynamic addition of new superhero entries

## Compiling and Running

In GitHub Codespaces (or using any standard C++ compiler), compile with:

    g++ -std=c++11 -o superhero_database superhero_database.cpp

Then run the program:

    ./superhero_database

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the database.
For options 3 and 6. You will follow the menu enter choice of 3 or 6, then enter choice 4 and the list will will display based on your last choice of 3 or 6. If you choose 4 before 3 or 6 it will just display them in the order theyre added in the code.
